# Features
- Displays the top 100 cryptocurrencies in rank order.
- Search functionality to find a specific cryptocurrency by name.
- Utilizes the CoinGecko API's markets endpoint to fetch cryptocurrency data.
- Implements React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management.
- Uses map and filter functions to extract the desired data from the search results.
- Retrieves and displays the following information from the API:
  -> Crypto Coin Name
  -> Coin Logo
  -> Symbol
  -> Price
  -> Volume
  -> Price Change (%)
  -> Market Cap
  
# Styling
The price change is styled dynamically based on its value. If the price change is negative, it will be displayed in red color, and if it is positive, it will be shown in green color. This provides visual cues to quickly identify the positive or negative change.
